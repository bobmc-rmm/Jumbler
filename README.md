# Jumbler
Command-line program to solve jumbled words by permutation and dictionary search

This effort was inspired by "Jumble - that inspired word game" -David L. Hoyt and Jeff Knurek-

There are four jumbled words of five or six letters in which some of the letters are circled.
The circled letters are the answer to a final empty jumble. There is a cartoon which suggests
a word or phrase of the solution.

Usage:
The only code file is jumble.c which is compiled by entering 'make'. The english dictionary is
in 'data3.txt'. And 'demo.txt' shows some test examples.  It worked with Xubuntu Linux. It 
uses standard libraries which should work on any platform with a few tweaks.
